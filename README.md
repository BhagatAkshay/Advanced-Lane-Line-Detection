# Advanced-Lane-Line-Detection
This repository contains my code for implementing advanced lane line detection with road curvature and relative vehicle position using a CV feauture extraction based pipeline
The main code is in the form of a jupyter notebook in python in the folder named 'src' with the project writeup as a docx file.
